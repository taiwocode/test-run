        The world is changed nowadays by automation and internet of things. Our lives is made easier and 
automated day by day with the development and revolution in modern technology caused by the 
Internet of Things. In recent era, health hazard is not an age dependent factor due to irregular lifestyle 
and busy schedule. Patients’ health is acquired by various sensors and then the data which is stored by 
the Internet of Things is displayed through the website that helps to access the remote monitoring. Thus, 
with the use of sensors, we can reduce human errors as well as the occupied space in the room is also 
reduced due to the size of the system. IOT in healthcare is the key player in providing better medical 
facilities to the patients and facilitates the doctors and hospitals as well. The system here consists of 
various medical devices such as sensors and web based or mobile based applications which 
communicate via network connected devices and helps to monitor and record patients’ health data and 
medical information. <br> outcome of the project is to build a system to provide world-class medical aid 
to the patients even in the remotest areas with no hospitals in their areas by connecting over the 
internet and grasping information through about their health status via the wearable pulse rate monitor 
provided using arduino microcontroller which would be able to record the patient’s heart rate and 
temperature. The system would be smart to intimate the patient’s family members and their doctor 
about the patient’s current health status and full medical information in case any medical emergency 
arises.
